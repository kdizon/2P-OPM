# -------------------------- Instructions ----------------------------------- #


# This is a script to run high-speed imaging with one or two (simultaneous) PCO Edge cameras and the NI DAQ card.

# It relies on Micro-Manager as an image viewer only.
# Control over the cameras, the stage (galvo), and the LED is done through the NI DAQ card.
# Control over the lasers is hardware-based.

# Although Micro-Manager has no control over the cameras, the imaging parameters have to 
# agree between this script and Micro-Manager to obtain all the images in the viewer.

# The following instructions indicate how to run different types of acquisition.


# ------ 2D, 2 camera imaging: stacks represent the frames to be taken ------ #

#    In this script:
# 1. Set multi_d = False
# 2. Set num_stacks to the number of frames desired
# 3. Set stack_delay_time to the desired delay between frames (not frame_delay_time), if any
# 4. Set any LED control if desired. If using "software_fraction", led_stack_fraction 
#    is the fraction of time the LED is on during each frame. If using "software_time",
#    led pulse width and frequency is independent of frame acquisition
# 5. Set exposure time, image height, and image width to the desired values
# 6. Set the readout mode as "fast" unless you particularly need the camera sensor to read out in slow mode

# 7. Run this script. A window will pop up. If the timing parameters are incorrect,
#    click "Cancel" and modify the parameters above in the script.

# 8. Open Micro-Manager and set: 
#    Core Cam -> Multi Camera
#    Multicam 1  -> pco_camera_1
#    Multicam 1 (trigger mode)  -> External Exp. Ctrl.
#    Multicam 2  -> pco_camera_2
#    Multicam 2 (trigger mode)  -> External Exp. Ctrl.
#    NIDAQ (sequence)  ->  Off

# 9. In Micro-Manager, open "Multi-D Acq":
#    Check "Time Points" and uncheck all other boxes
#    Under "Time Points", set "Counts" to the value of Total number of time points shown in the pop up window
#    Under "Time Points", set "Interval" to the delay between frames (stack_delay_time), if any
#    Check that the time units is seconds (s)

# 10. In Micro-Manager, click "Acquire!"

# 11. Right after, click "OK" in the pop up window




# ------ 3D, 2 camera imaging: stacks represent 3D stacks, frames are the z-slices in each ------ #

#    In this script:
# 1. Set multi_d = True
# 2. Set num_stacks to the number of volumes (3D stacks) desired
# 3. Set stack_delay_time to the desired delay (interval) between 3D stacks
# 4. Set z_start and z_end to the desired start and end of the z stack, and z_step
# 5. Set frame_delay_time to the desired delay between z slices, if any
# 6. Set any LED control if desired. If using "software_fraction", led_stack_fraction 
#    is the fraction of time the LED is on during each 3D stack. If using "software_time",
#    led pulse width and frequency is independent of frame acquisition
# 7. Set exposure time, image height, and image width to the desired values
# 8. Set the readout mode as "fast" unless you particularly need the camera sensor to read out in slow mode

# 9. Run this script. A window will pop up. If the timing parameters are incorrect,
#    click "Cancel" and modify the parameters above in the script.

# 10. Open Micro-Manager and set: 
#    Core Cam -> Multi Camera
#    Multicam 1  -> pco_camera_1
#    Multicam 1 (trigger mode)  -> External Exp. Ctrl.
#    Multicam 2  -> pco_camera_2
#    Multicam 2 (trigger mode)  -> External Exp. Ctrl.
#    NIDAQ (sequence)  ->  Off

# 11. In Micro-Manager, open "Multi-D Acq":
#    Check "Time Points" and uncheck all other boxes
#    Under "Time Points", set "Counts" to the value of Total number of time points shown in the pop up window
#    Under "Time Points", set "Interval" to the delay between frames (stack_delay_time), if any
#    Check that the time units is seconds (s)

# 12. In Micro-Manager, click "Acquire!"

# 13. Right after, click "OK" in the pop up window

# Important: for now, long interval times between stacks might not work with the Micro-Manager viewer



# -------------------------- 1 camera imaging ----------------------------------- #

# In Micro-Manager, set:
#    Core Cam -> pco_camera_1 or pco_camera_2 
#    Multicam 1  -> pco_camera_1
#    Multicam 1 (trigger mode)  -> External Exp. Ctrl.
#    NIDAQ (sequence)  ->  Off

# If Multi-D Acq in Micro-Manager is open, close it and reopen it

# All other steps are the same as above


# -------------------------------- notes ---------------------------------------- #


# You can see acquisition status in Micro-Manager in the home page, next to a yellow bell icon
# that appears while Multi-D Acq is running. 

# If at some point Micro-Manager freezes and does not finish the acquisition, run this script 
# again independently and as many times as needed. This will complete the acquisition in Micro-Manager
# and let you close it and re-start a new one.
